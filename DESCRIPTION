Description: Implements a range of facilities for post-hoc analysis and
             summarizing linear models, generalized linear models and 
             generalized linear mixed models, including grouping and clustering 
             via pairwise comparisons using graph representations and efficient
             algorithms for finding maximal cliques of a graph. 
             Includes also non-parametric toos for post-hoc analysis.
             It has S3 methods for printing summarizing, and producing plots, 
             line and barplots suitable for post-hoc analyses.
